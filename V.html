				<h4>Ode to my Love</h4>
					<p> Rumi ( The Persian poet) described Love as the " Water of Life" but if he had met you he would have descirbe it as the touch of your hands and the twinkle in your eyes.he would have described it as your fingers entwinned with mine as we hold the thumb and pinkies togther inside. Love's defintion for me is in your face, the dimples in the corners of your smile, and your smoooth skin and the way your laugh reverberates when you are truly laughing.</p>

                    <p> You have shown me throughout our time together that love is more than just the emotion and the promise, and the hugs, and the kisses. You have shown me the type of love that people dream about and that many desire when their heads hit the pillow. You have shown me the tenderness and caring of sweet love with the fiery passion of deep love.</p>

                    <p> You have seen me at my worst and at my best and at both of these moments you have embraced, celebrated or cried with me and you have helped me not only become a better of person for you but for myself</p>

                    <p> Thank you for bringing joy into my everyday and for making me feel supported even when I am away from all I knew.</p>

                    <p> I love making you laugh and sweeping you off your feet. I love holding you in a tight hug while you pretend to want to slip away and then proceed to tickle me to death. I love when your smile peers from under the covers and lets me know I am in the exact place I was meant to be. </p>

                    <p>Your beauty and character reeled me in but it was your intellect, passion, creativity, love, curiosity, laughter, and perseverance that kept me and enammored me everyday more and more. I hope to discover the world by your side and to see all the different people we become next to each other.</p> 

                    <p> I love you, Sydney Cush, My Girl</p>
